# geometry_AngleAndOrientation
Calculating `angle` and `orientation` between three points in Python

## Getting started
Three points R (xR, yR), G (xG, yG) and B (xB, yB) in the plane are given.
* The `angle` can be obtained with the `scalar product`
* The `orientation` is obtained with the `triple product`

## Prerequisites
* Python 3.* 
* Matplotlib 


## Demo
Choose three points to calculate the angle and orientation between them.
